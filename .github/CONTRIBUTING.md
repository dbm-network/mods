# Contributing

**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/3QxkZPK) instead of opening an issue â€“ you will get redirected there anyway.**

If you wish to contribute to the DBM Network modifications collection or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request, additionally, make sure to add relevant documentation to the [mods.json](https://github.com/dbm-network/mods/blob/master/docs/mods.json) file.
We use [ESLint](https://github.com/dbm-network/mods/blob/master/.eslintrc.json, 'Config') and [Prettier](https://github.com/dbm-network/mods/blob/master/.prettierrc.json, 'Config') to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice is a great boon to your development process.
