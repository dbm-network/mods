**Do not forget that that gives Bot Owner status according to DBM( as in access to anything set as _Bot Owner Only_ )**

Insert the desired owner's Discord ID, It **MUST** be the discord id, not the name of the user
(Right click -> Copy ID on the users name with developer mode enabled)
Once you click the + to add the id, you may close the extension and restart your bot.

Failure to restart your bot will result in the user to not have Bot Owner Only status
